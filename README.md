### Meteor - Multiplatform (Desktop/Android) Private  
---
**This connects to 2004scape.org by default and follows their rules diligently**

# Info
This private repo contains a proxy that I don't want in public use as it allows java clients to connect to live servers.  
The project was entirely re-written using a shared code concept using Compose with no reflection / injection  
This unified code concept is still very new so a lot of things have regressed (input on android)  
most things have been moved to common already but there is always room for improvement!  

```
Forbidden features (unless otherwise permitted by Lost-City):  
    artificial input of any kind  
    camera zoom / middle mouse rotate  
    menu entry swapping (including changing menu entry text)
    overlays of any kind over the game
    visual game state tracking in UI form be it swing or compose

    Per Pazaz:
    "in general: donâ€™t give yourself an advantage that forces a new meta on the community.
        The original experience should be a viable option for people to play with"

    Per Zeruth:
    "We will absolutely be respecting the project here, if things change regarding content
        that is forbidden or not, it will be reflected here."
